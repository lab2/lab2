## Farewell to code

After more than two decades in IT—starting in 1985 as a hobbyist developer (C64, Assembler) and later exploring a range of technical roles, supported by a higher-level education—I’ve decided to step away from programming and testing entirely. This repository stands as a testament to my passion for coding over the years, but I will no longer write or maintain any code moving forward.

While I’m grateful for the journey, I’m now closing this chapter to pursue new challenges in a completely different field.

All my projects (snippets) have been consolidated into the "Experiments" repository—a curated archive of my pragmatic ideas and work.

## Why I’m Done

Frankly, I’m fed up with the endless noise around testing, frameworks, and the illusion of control. Quality is a mindset—not a checklist, not a toolchain. If that mindset isn’t present, no amount of ceremony will fix it. And if the industry insists on mistaking rituals for substance, then count me out. 

## Companies I’ve Worked For

Over the years, I’ve contributed to projects at the following organizations:

- 🏛️ **Swiss Federal Administration**
- 💼 **Credit Suisse Group AG**  
- 📬 **Swiss Post Ltd**
