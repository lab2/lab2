## Farewell to code

After more than two decades in ITâ€”starting in 1985 as a hobbyist developer (C64, Assembler) and later exploring a range of technical roles, supported by a higher-level educationâ€”Iâ€™ve decided to step away from programming and testing entirely. This repository stands as a testament to my passion for coding over the years, but I will no longer write or maintain any code moving forward.

While Iâ€™m grateful for the journey, Iâ€™m now closing this chapter to pursue new challenges in a completely different field.

## Why Iâ€™m Done

Frankly, Iâ€™m fed up with the endless noise around testing, frameworks, and the illusion of control. Quality is a mindsetâ€”not a checklist, not a toolchain. If that mindset isnâ€™t present, no amount of ceremony will fix it. And if the industry insists on mistaking rituals for substance, then count me out.

Over time, I also came to realize that the leadership environments I worked in often lacked the clarity, courage, and vision needed to truly empower teams. While there were moments of support, they were too often overshadowed by hesitation, and a focus on appearances rather than outcomes. That, too, made it harder to stay engaged.

Quality is a mindset, not a checklist. Iâ€™m done with noise, rituals, and silos. TEAMS not silos should be the rule, yet too often it wasnâ€™t (negative kudos to Raffello, Yasser, Peter, Siegfried) â€” encounters that taught me mostly how not to lead.
